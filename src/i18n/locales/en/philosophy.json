  "introduction": "Bitcoin raises profound philosophical questions: What is real? Where does value come from? What is freedom? When a string of numbers can be worth fortunes, when algorithms replace human will, when consensus creates new realities, we need to re-examine these eternal philosophical propositions. Bitcoin is not just technological innovation, but a philosophical exploration of the nature of existence.",
