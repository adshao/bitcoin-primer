  "introduction": "Bitcoin mining directly converts energy into economic value, revealing the deep connection between energy, information, and value. From the second law of thermodynamics to information theory, Bitcoin embodies the bridge between the physical and digital worlds. It's not just a controversial point of energy consumption, but a paradigm shift in how human civilization utilizes energy.",
