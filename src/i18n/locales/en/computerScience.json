  "introduction": "Bitcoin is a culmination of multiple fields in computer science. It ingeniously combines cryptography, distributed systems, peer-to-peer networks, and game theory to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem that had long puzzled computer scientists. Through Proof of Work, Bitcoin creates a trustless distributed ledger, marking a significant breakthrough in computer science history.",
