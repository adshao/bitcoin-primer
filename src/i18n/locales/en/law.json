  "introduction": "Bitcoin is not just a technological innovation, but a legal experiment. It challenges the fundamental assumptions of traditional legal systems: Who has the right to make rules? How are contracts enforced? What are property rights? When code becomes the enforcer of rules, when cryptography replaces the coercive power of courts, we need to rethink the nature of law itself.",
