  "introduction": "Bitcoin is a carefully designed game system. The interests of miners, users, and developers are balanced through clever incentive mechanisms. From the prisoner's dilemma of mining to the cost-benefit analysis of 51% attacks, Bitcoin demonstrates how to maintain system security through economic incentives rather than legal enforcement. This is a perfect real-world application of game theory.",
