  "introduction": "The banking system is the core infrastructure of the modern economy, but its fractional reserve system and centralized architecture are also the root causes of financial crises. Bitcoin offers a peer-to-peer value transfer method without banks, challenging the necessity of banks as financial intermediaries. This is not just technological innovation, but a fundamental rethinking of the nature of financial services.",
