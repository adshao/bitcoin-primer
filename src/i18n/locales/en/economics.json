  "subtitle": "From Scarcity to Value: The Economic Principles of Bitcoin",
  "introduction": "Economics studies the allocation of scarce resources. Bitcoin creates absolute scarcity through algorithms, challenging many assumptions of traditional economics. From Austrian School monetary theory to modern macroeconomics, Bitcoin provides a real-world laboratory for economic theory. It's not just a monetary phenomenon, but a rethinking of value, incentives, and economic coordination mechanisms.",
